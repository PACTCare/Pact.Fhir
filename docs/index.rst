Introduction
============
FHIR solutions are built from a set of modular components called "Resources". These resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives. FHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts â€“ mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.

To get an abstract idea how the FHIR project is organized you might want to take a look at the design UML. It can be opened on draw.io
